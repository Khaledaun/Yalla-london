### Featured Yachts Presentation

| Pattern | Used By | Details |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Handpicked broker selections | Burgess, CharterWorld, Fraser | Curated by charter brokers, labeled as "featured" or "recommended" |
| Grid cards with key specs | YachtCharterFleet, Northrop & Johnson, Camper & Nicholsons | Card layout showing: yacht name, length, builder, year, guests, cabins, crew, price/week |
| Destination-grouped | Boatbookings | Yachts shown within destination context |
| Peer-rated listings | Click&Boat | Owner-uploaded listings with user ratings and reviews |

**Industry Standard:** 3-4 column grid of yacht cards showing hero image, name, length, guest capacity, and starting price. Cards link to full detail pages.

### Trust Signals & Social Proof

| Signal | Who Uses It | Implementation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Heritage/founding year | Burgess (1975), Camper & Nicholsons (1782), Northrop & Johnson (1949), Fraser (1947) | Prominently displayed in hero or header. Heritage = trust in luxury segment. |
| Fleet size | YachtCharterFleet (4,197+), Fraser (3,500+), CharterWorld (3,000+), Click&Boat (40,000+) | Exact numbers displayed to signal comprehensive selection |
| Portfolio value | Fraser ($7.4B / EUR7B) | Dollar figure signals scale and credibility |
| Team size | Fraser (240+ professionals, 21 locations) | Shows global reach |
| Client testimonials | CharterWorld, YachtCharterFleet | Star ratings with quotes from charter guests |
| Media mentions | CharterWorld (The Guardian) | External media credibility |
| Trustpilot/external reviews | YachtCharterFleet | Third-party verification |
| Partner network | Northrop & Johnson (NetJets partnership) | Exclusive luxury partner access |
| Sustainability commitment | Burgess, CharterWorld (Seakeepers Society) | Environmental stewardship signals |
| User/member counts | Click&Boat (550,000+ members) | Social proof through community size |

**Industry Standard:** Heritage year + fleet size + global office count. Luxury brokerages lean on reputation; marketplaces lean on user counts and ratings.

### CTA Placement

| Pattern | Sites | Details |
|---------|-------|---------|
| "Enquire" / "Contact Broker" | Burgess, CharterWorld, Fraser, Camper & Nicholsons, Boatbookings | Inquiry-based, broker-mediated. Never "Book Now." |
| "Start Planning" | Northrop & Johnson | Softer CTA leading to guided journey |
| "Search" / "Find a Boat" | YachtCharterFleet, Click&Boat | Direct action search-based CTA |
| "Instant Book" | Click&Boat | Marketplace-style immediate booking |

**Key Insight:** The luxury segment NEVER uses "Book Now." It is always "Enquire," "Request a Quote," or "Contact a Broker." The booking is broker-mediated, not transactional. Only marketplace platforms (Click&Boat) use instant booking.

### Navigation Structure

| Site | Primary Nav Items | Notable Features |
|------|------------------|------------------|
| **Burgess** | Charter, Buy, Sell, Build, Manage, About, News | Service-oriented. Clean top-level categories. |

## B. YACHT SEARCH/LISTING PAGE BENCHMARK

### Filter Types & UI

| Site | Filter UI | Filter Location | Notable Approach |
|------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Burgess** | Dropdown filters | Top bar | Clean minimal filters |
| **YachtCharterFleet** | Advanced multi-filter | Top bar + dedicated filter pages | Multiple search paths: by type, by amenity, by name, by designer. Most comprehensive. |
| **CharterWorld** | Category-based browsing | Sidebar + category pages | Filter by: type, features (stabilizers, hot tubs, helicopters), brand new, best picks |
| **Northrop & Johnson** | Algolia-powered real-time search | Top bar with dropdowns | Real-time search with Algolia. Filters: type, size, cabins, amenities, shipbuilder. Industry-leading speed. |
| **Fraser** | Browse + broker curation | Top bar | "Browse or contact a broker for a personally curated selection" |
| **Camper & Nicholsons** | Dedicated search page | `/search-charter` with filter panel | Filters: vessel type, name, length, location, capacity, price. Clean dedicated search page. |
| **Click&Boat** | Marketplace-style filters | Top bar + sidebar | Destination, dates, boat type, passengers, activities, price range. Most granular for self-service. |
| **Boatbookings** | Destination-driven browse | Category pages | Less filter-driven, more editorial/guide-driven discovery. |

**Industry Standard:** Top-bar horizontal filter strip with dropdowns for: yacht type, length/size range, guest capacity, destination, price range. Advanced filters for amenities expand on click. Real-time filtering (Algolia or equivalent) is the gold standard set by Northrop & Johnson.

### Card Design

Best-in-class yacht listing cards include:

| Element | Required? | Details |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Hero image | Required | High-res exterior shot. Landscape 16:9 or 3:2 ratio. |
| Yacht name | Required | Bold, prominent. Often in uppercase or serif font. |
| Length (meters + feet) | Required | e.g., "72.10m" or "72m (236ft)" |
| Builder/shipyard | Required | e.g., "VSY - Viareggio SuperYachts" |
| Year built (+ refit) | Required | e.g., "2015 (2025)" — refit year critical for luxury market |
| Guest capacity | Required | e.g., "12 guests" |
| Cabin count | Required | e.g., "6 cabins" |
| Crew count | Common | e.g., "17 crew" |
| Charter price | Common | e.g., "From: US$ 695,000 p/w" — weekly rate |
| Destination/location | Common | Current charter region |
| Yacht type badge | Common | Motor Yacht, Sailing Yacht, Catamaran, Explorer |

**Hover Effects:** Subtle image zoom, overlay with "View Details" CTA, or secondary image reveal. Never flashy animations.

### Sorting Options

Standard sorting across top sites:
- Price: Low to High / High to Low
- Length: Shortest to Longest / Longest to Shortest
- Year built: Newest First
- Recently added/updated
- Featured/recommended (broker-curated, often default)

### Map Integration

| Site | Map | Details |
|------|-----|---------|
| YachtCharterFleet | A-Z destination map page | `/destination/map-me.htm` — interactive global map of charter regions |
| Click&Boat | Integrated map view | Map + list split view for browsing by location |
| Northrop & Johnson | Destination map | Interactive map showing charter regions |
| Others | No integrated map on search | Destinations handled as separate pages/sections |

**Industry Standard:** Map integration is common on marketplace platforms but NOT standard on luxury brokerages. Brokerages rely on destination landing pages instead.

### Price Display Format

| Format | Used By | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Weekly rate (starting from) | Burgess, Fraser, Camper & Nicholsons, YachtCharterFleet, CharterWorld | "From EUR 250,000 p/w" |
| Multi-currency display | YachtCharterFleet | Shows price in USD, EUR, GBP |
| "POA" (Price on Application) | Burgess, Fraser | For top-tier yachts (100m+), price hidden |
| Daily rate | Click&Boat | "From EUR 500/day" |
| Range with seasonal variation | Click&Boat, Boatbookings | Low season vs. high season pricing |

**Key Insight:** Luxury brokerages use WEEKLY rates as standard (the industry unit). Marketplaces use daily rates. "POA" is used for ultra-luxury yachts where pricing is negotiated. Multi-currency display (USD/EUR/GBP) is expected at the top tier.

### Pagination

| Approach | Sites | Details |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Traditional pagination | YachtCharterFleet, Camper & Nicholsons, Northrop & Johnson | Page numbers at bottom. Standard for large fleets. |
| Load more button | Fraser, Burgess | "Show more" button for progressive loading. |
| Infinite scroll | Click&Boat | Continuous loading as user scrolls. |

**Industry Standard:** Traditional pagination for luxury brokerages (signals deliberate curation). Infinite scroll for marketplaces (signals abundance).

## F. DESIGN & VISUAL STANDARDS BENCHMARK

### Color Palettes

| Category | Colors | Used By |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Navy + White + Gold** | Deep navy (#0A1628 - #1B2838), white (#FFFFFF), gold accents (#C5A572 - #D4AF37) | Burgess, Fraser, Northrop & Johnson, Camper & Nicholsons |
| **Dark Blue + Silver** | Midnight blue, silver/platinum accents | CharterWorld |
| **Navy + Teal + White** | Navy base with teal/aegean blue highlights | YachtCharterFleet |
| **Blue + White + Orange accents** | Fresh blue palette with warm accent | Click&Boat |
| **Navy + Aqua** | Deep navy with aquamarine touches | Boatbookings |

**Industry Standard:** Navy + White + Gold is the dominant luxury yacht color palette. Navy = authority/ocean, White = clean/premium, Gold = luxury/exclusivity. No exceptions at the luxury tier.

### Typography Choices

| Role | Font Type | Examples | Used By |
|------|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Headlines** | Serif (elegant, heritage) | Playfair Display, Georgia, Palatino, Copperplate Gothic, Dutch 801 | Burgess, Camper & Nicholsons, Fraser |
| **Body text** | Sans-serif (clean, readable) | Poppins, Open Sans, Calibri, Lato, Helvetica Neue | All sites |
| **Yacht names** | Uppercase serif or tracking-wide sans | Custom or Copperplate Gothic | All luxury brokerages |
| **Navigation** | Clean sans-serif, medium weight | System fonts or custom sans | All sites |

**Industry Standard:** Serif headlines + Sans-serif body. The heading font conveys heritage and luxury; the body font ensures readability. Letter-spacing (tracking) on uppercase elements is common for nautical elegance.

### Image Quality Standards

| Standard | Requirement | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Resolution | Minimum 2000px wide for hero images | Retina-quality on all devices |
| Photography | Professional yacht photography only | No stock photos, no amateur shots |
| Angles | Exterior (aerial, waterline, stern), Interior (salon, master suite, dining), Lifestyle (dining, swimming, sunset) | Minimum 15-20 images per yacht |
| Format | WebP with JPEG fallback | Balance quality and performance |
| Aspect ratio | 16:9 (hero), 3:2 (cards), 1:1 (thumbnails) | Consistent across fleet |
| Video | 4K flyover/walkthrough | Increasingly expected on 50m+ yachts |

**Key Insight:** Image quality is NON-NEGOTIABLE in the luxury yacht segment. Poor photography immediately destroys credibility. All top sites use exclusively professional yacht photography with consistent color grading.

### White Space Usage

| Approach | Sites | Details |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Generous white space | Burgess, Fraser, Northrop & Johnson | Wide margins, large padding between sections. Signals luxury through restraint. |
| Moderate white space | Camper & Nicholsons, YachtCharterFleet | Balanced information density. |
| Dense/content-rich | CharterWorld, Boatbookings | More text-heavy, editorial approach. |
| Clean/minimal | Click&Boat | Modern, card-based UI with ample padding. |

**Industry Standard:** Luxury brokerages use GENEROUS white space. Every element breathes. Dense layouts signal "budget" in the yacht market.

### Animation & Micro-Interactions

| Pattern | Prevalence | Details |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Subtle parallax scrolling | Common | Background images move at different speed on scroll. 1-2 sections max. |
| Image hover zoom | Very common | Yacht card images zoom slightly (1.05x-1.1x) on hover |
| Smooth scroll transitions | Common | Sections fade in on scroll-reveal |
| Loading skeleton screens | Emerging | Placeholder layouts while images load |
| Gallery lightbox transitions | Standard | Smooth fade/slide between gallery images |
| Sticky header opacity shift | Common | Header becomes semi-transparent or solid on scroll |
| **NOT used** | N/A | Flashy animations, bouncing elements, spinning loaders, complex CSS animations. These DESTROY luxury perception. |

**Industry Standard:** SUBTLE is the rule. Luxury means restraint. Micro-interactions should be barely perceptible. If a user notices the animation, it is too much.

### Mobile Responsiveness

| Approach | Sites | Details |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Fully responsive | All 8 sites | All sites are mobile-responsive in 2026 |
| Mobile-first design | Click&Boat | Native iOS/Android apps as primary experience |
| Mobile-optimized | Northrop & Johnson | ADA compliant, fast-loading, mobile-first |
| Responsive redesign | Fraser | Current site is responsive after Relevance redesign |

**Industry Standard:** All luxury yacht sites are fully responsive. Mobile is no longer optional. Click&Boat goes further with native apps. Desktop still dominates for research-heavy browsing but mobile captures initial discovery.

### Luxury "Feel" Indicators

The following design elements signal "luxury" to UHNW visitors:

1. **Generous white space** — Never crowded, never cluttered
2. **Serif typography** for headings — Signals heritage, authority, refinement
3. **Navy + gold color palette** — Universal luxury nautical signifier
4. **Full-width imagery** — Edge-to-edge, cinematic quality
5. **Minimal text overlays** — Let images speak
6. **Subtle animations** — Nothing flashy, nothing bouncing
7. **Heritage mentions** — Founded date, years of service, tradition
8. **Aspirational copywriting** — "Your great escape," "inimitable style," "freedom"
9. **Broker-mediated CTAs** — "Enquire" not "Buy Now"
10. **No visible pricing on top-tier yachts** — "POA" signals exclusivity
11. **High image-to-text ratio** — Visuals dominate
12. **No stock photography** — Every image is real, specific, owned
13. **No social proof counters** — No "X people viewed this" (cheap tactic)
14. **No urgency pop-ups** — No countdown timers, no "only 2 left" signals
15. **Clean footer** — Structured, informative, not promotional

### Meta Tag Patterns

**Title Tag Formula:**
```
{Yacht Name} Yacht Charter Price - {Builder} {Type} | {Company}
```
Example: `APOGEE Yacht Charter Price - Codecasa Luxury Yacht Charter | Fraser`

YachtCharterFleet pattern: `FLYING FOX Yacht Charter Price - Lurssen Yachts Luxury Yacht Charter`

**Meta Description Formula:**
```
Charter the {length} {type} {yacht name} with {cabin count} {config} for {guest count} guests. {Key feature}. {Location}. Contact {company} for rates.
```
120-160 characters. Always includes yacht name, length, guest capacity, and CTA.

**Open Graph:**
- `og:type`: `website` or `product`
- `og:image`: Primary yacht exterior photo (high-res, 1200x630px)
- `og:title`: Same as title tag
- `og:description`: Same as meta description

### URL Structure Conventions

| Page Type | Pattern | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Yacht listing** | `/yachts/` or `/yachts-for-charter/` | `/yachts-for-charter/` (Fraser) |
| **Yacht detail** | `/yacht-for-charter/{slug}/` | `/en/yacht-for-charter/apogee/` (Fraser) |
| **Yacht detail alt** | `/luxury-charter-yacht-{id}/{name}.htm` | `/luxury-charter-yacht-50836/flying-fox.htm` (YCF) |
| **Destination hub** | `/destinations/` | `/en/destinations/` (Fraser) |
| **Destination detail** | `/destinations/{slug}/` or `/yacht-charter-destinations/{slug}` | `/yacht-charter-destinations/caribbean-sea` (C&N) |
| **Itinerary** | `/itineraries/` or `/yacht-charter/itineraries` | `/yacht-charter/itineraries` (N&J) |
| **Charter search** | `/search-charter` or `/charter/` | `/search-charter` (C&N), `/charter` (YCF) |
| **Blog/news** | `/editorial/news/` or `/news/` | `/en/editorial/news/` (Burgess) |
| **How to charter** | `/how-to-charter/` | `/en/how-to-charter-a-yacht/` (Fraser) |

**Industry Standard:** Clean, readable, keyword-rich slugs. No query parameters in canonical URLs. Language prefix for multilingual (`/en/`, `/fr/`). Hyphens as word separators. All lowercase.

### Internal Linking Strategy

| Strategy | Implementation | Who Does It Best |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Similar yachts** | 3-6 related yacht cards on every detail page | YachtCharterFleet, Fraser |
| **Destination cross-links** | Yacht pages link to destination guides | Burgess, Boatbookings |
| **Blog-to-yacht links** | Editorial content links to relevant yacht listings | YachtCharterFleet, CharterWorld |
| **Type/amenity category pages** | Category pages link to matching yachts | YachtCharterFleet (by type, by amenity, by designer) |
| **Breadcrumb navigation** | Hierarchical breadcrumbs on all pages | Fraser, Northrop & Johnson |
| **Charter guide cross-links** | "How to charter" pages link to search and specific yachts | Northrop & Johnson, Fraser |
| **Seasonal/event content** | Boat show pages link to featured yachts | Burgess, YachtCharterFleet |

**Industry Standard:** Every yacht detail page MUST link to: (a) similar yachts, (b) destination guide, (c) inquiry form, (d) charter guide. Every blog post MUST link to relevant yacht listings. Descriptive anchor text always (never "click here").

### Content Depth Per Page Type

| Page Type | Word Count | Content Elements |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Yacht detail** | 800-2,000 | Specs, description, accommodation, amenities, crew, destination, reviews |
| **Destination hub** | 300-500 | Regional overview with cards |
| **Destination detail** | 1,000-3,000 | Editorial guide, itineraries, seasonal info, yacht suggestions |
| **Blog/editorial** | 800-2,500 | Industry news, charter guides, lifestyle content |
| **Charter guide** | 1,500-3,000 | How-to content, FAQ, first-timer guidance |
| **Homepage** | 500-1,000 | Aspirational copy, service descriptions, featured content |

### Blog/Content Marketing Integration

| Site | Content Volume | Topics | Frequency |
|------|---------------|--------|-----------|
| **YachtCharterFleet** | Very high | News, yachts, destinations, events, advice, inspiration, experiences, reviews, itineraries, POIs | Daily |
| **Burgess** | High | Industry news, design, lifestyle, heritage, events | Weekly |
| **CharterWorld** | High | Yacht design news, sustainability, industry updates | Several per week |
| **Fraser** | Moderate | Yacht features, destination guides, buying guides | Weekly |
| **Boatbookings** | High | Destination guides (43+ per region), planning advice | Regular |
| **Northrop & Johnson** | Moderate | Lifestyle content, itineraries, destination guides | Regular |
| **Click&Boat** | Low-moderate | How-to guides, destination tips | Irregular |

**Industry Standard:** Content marketing is CRITICAL for organic visibility in this segment. Top performers publish multiple pieces per week. Destination guides, itinerary content, and yacht features drive organic traffic. Every piece of content must link back to yacht listings.

## H. PERFORMANCE & UX BENCHMARK

### Loading Strategies

| Strategy | Implementation | Who Does It |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Lazy loading images** | Gallery images load only when scrolled into view | All modern implementations |
| **Progressive image loading** | Low-res placeholder → full resolution | Best practice for yacht galleries |
| **WebP with JPEG fallback** | 32-45% file size reduction | Fraser (redesigned), Northrop & Johnson |
| **CDN distribution** | Images served from nearest edge location | Northrop & Johnson (enterprise caching), Click&Boat |
| **Skeleton screens** | Placeholder layout while content loads | Click&Boat, emerging on others |
| **Critical CSS inlining** | Above-fold CSS loaded first | Best practice |
| **Hero image preload** | `<link rel="preload">` for hero yacht image | Critical for LCP |
| **Server-side caching** | Redis/database cache for yacht data | Northrop & Johnson (enterprise-level caching) |
| **API data sync** | Cron-based yacht data sync instead of live API calls | Click&Boat, Northrop & Johnson |

### Core Web Vitals Targets

| Metric | Target | Challenge for Yacht Sites |
|--------|--------|--------------------------|
| **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint) | < 2.5 seconds | High-res yacht imagery is the #1 bottleneck. Average yacht site: 4.2s. |
| **INP** (Interaction to Next Paint) | < 200ms | Complex filter interactions on search pages |
| **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift) | < 0.1 | Image galleries without dimension attributes cause layout shift |

**Key Insight:** Most luxury yacht websites FAIL Core Web Vitals due to high-resolution imagery. The sites that pass do so through aggressive image optimization (WebP, responsive srcset, lazy loading, CDN) and enterprise-level caching.

### Mobile-First Patterns

| Pattern | Implementation | Priority |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Hamburger menu | Standard top-right placement | Required |
| Sticky CTA button | "Enquire" button fixed at bottom of viewport on mobile | Critical for conversion |
| Swipeable image galleries | Touch-friendly carousel with swipe gestures | Required |
| Collapsible spec sections | Accordion-style for specifications, amenities, crew | Common |
| Click-to-call phone number | `tel:` link for broker contact | Required |
| Responsive image sizing | `srcset` with breakpoints at 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px | Required |
| Touch-friendly filters | Full-screen filter modal on mobile (not sidebar) | Best practice |

### Accessibility Considerations

| Standard | Implementation | Who Prioritizes |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| ADA/WCAG compliance | Target AA compliance minimum | Northrop & Johnson (explicitly ADA compliant) |
| Image alt text | Descriptive alt text on all yacht photos | Required for SEO and accessibility |
| Keyboard navigation | All interactive elements keyboard-accessible | Best practice |
| Color contrast | Navy on white passes AA, ensure gold text has sufficient contrast | Required |
| Focus indicators | Visible focus states on interactive elements | Required |
| ARIA labels | On dynamic elements (filters, carousels, modals) | Best practice |
| Screen reader support | Semantic HTML, proper heading hierarchy | Required |

**Industry Standard:** ADA compliance is increasingly required, especially for US-facing yacht brokerages. Northrop & Johnson explicitly mandates it.

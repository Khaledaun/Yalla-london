# ARABALDIVES RESEARCH REPORT
## Comprehensive Launch Strategy for Luxury Maldives Travel Site (Arabic-First)

---

## 1. DESIGN STRATEGY

### Color Palette & Visual Identity

**Primary Palette: Turquoise & Coral**
Contemporary Maldives resort design features strategic use of turquoise, coral, and navy in artwork, furnishings, and architectural accents against a base of white and natural wood. Ocean-inspired palettes range from deep navy of the abyss to the turquoise of tropical waters, with sandy beiges, coral pinks, and pearlescent whites completing the palette, reflecting serenity, openness, and calm.

**Color Applications:**
- **Turquoise shades**: Evoke pristine waters and tropical escapes, aligning perfectly with luxurious overwater bungalows and beachfront stays
- **Coral accents**: Provide warmth and energy, complementing the tropical aesthetic
- **Navy depths**: Create sophisticated contrast and ground the lighter palette
- **Neutral base**: White and natural wood allow the vibrant ocean colors to breathe

**2025-2026 Luxury Design Principles:**
- Luxury buyers in 2026 are more visually literate than ever; success comes down to restraint, contrast, and palettes that feel intentional, not trendy
- Most luxury sites rely on 2-3 core colors supported by neutrals
- The subtle aqua blue palette feels dreamy and upscale, essential for premium positioning

### RTL (Right-to-Left) Arabic Layout Requirements

**Critical RTL Implementation:**
- Layout must prioritize seamless, intuitive navigation structure that aligns with reading patterns of RTL users
- All interactive elements and textual content must flow naturally from right to left
- Elements that typically appear on the left in LTR designs (navigation menus, sidebars, progress indicators) should mirror to the right in RTL

**Technical Considerations:**
- RTL themes must showcase holiday houses, rental villas, vacation rental apartments, hotels, and B&Bs
- Website builders must offer comprehensive tools designed specifically for the travel industry and optimized for multilingual, multi-directional content

### Visual Assets

**Hero Imagery Focus:**
- Overwater villas with turquoise water views
- Pristine white sand beaches with coral reef visibility
- Luxury resort amenities showcasing Islamic-friendly features
- Romantic honeymoon settings
- Underwater photography featuring marine life (manta rays, whale sharks, coral reefs)

## 2. CONTENT STRATEGY & SEO

### Primary Content Pillars

**Mobile-First Priority:**
Mobile devices are responsible for 62.54% of global website traffic. The site must be mobile-optimized from day one.

### Keyword Strategy

**High-Value Tourism Keywords:**

- Core keywords: "overwater bungalows Maldives," "luxury resorts Maldives," "family-friendly resorts Maldives"
- Multilingual focus: Incorporate keywords in Arabic, with secondary English support

### Arabic Content Gap Analysis

**Critical Market Opportunity:**
- Major review platforms (Dreaming of Maldives, Oyster, TripAdvisor) offer limited to no Arabic content
- TripAdvisor shows only 3 Arabic reviews compared to 2,387 English, 883 Russian, and 464 Chinese reviews

   - Alcohol-free zone options
   - Modest beachwear-friendly resorts

   - Reef accessibility
   - Water villa availability
   - Family vs. honeymoon suitability

3. **Honeymoon Planning Content**
   - Seasonal recommendations
   - Budget breakdowns
   - Romantic experiences
   - Privacy-focused resorts

4. **Practical Travel Information**
   - Visa requirements (free 30-day on arrival)
   - Halal food availability (100% halal meat nationwide)
   - Prayer facilities
   - Modest dress guidelines
   - Currency and tipping
